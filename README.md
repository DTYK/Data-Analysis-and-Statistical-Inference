# Data-Analysis-and-Statistical-Inference-Project

Your independent data analysis project will be done in two phases.

# Phase 1: Project Proposal

Identify a research question similar to questions we’ve talked about in this course. Choose a dataset, and one or two variables from that dataset, with which to answer this question using a hypothesis test or confidence intervals (the dataset used is entirely up to you, it can be one of the datasets listed below under "Datasets for the Project", or another one of your own choosing). You should pick two variables of interest, and you will be exploring the relationship between them. These variables should be either numerical and categorical, or both categorical (but they cannot be both numerical, see below for examples). All analysis must be completed in R.

# Phase 2: Data Analysis Project

Once you receive feedback on your proposal, you will then continue onto the data analysis project. You will answer the research question you developed in the proposal phase using methods you’ve learned in this class, and summarize your findings into a report. All analysis must be completed in R. 

Project grade: 63.5/65
